> **Lifecycle**: Living (update daily/weekly during active development)

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29 (morning)

**Version**: 0.2.2-alpha (MCP Remote Server + Claude/ChatGPT Distribution)
**Infrastructure**: DigitalOcean VPS (shared with do-vps-prod services)

---

## Business Direction (2025-11-26)

### Upcoming Validation
- **Demo scheduled**: Thursday 10am (next week) with dental practice owner
- **Purpose**: Validate product-market fit, gather feedback, identify missing features
- **Key questions**: Does it solve the pain? What's missing? What would they pay?

### Target Avatar (Refined 2025-11-27)
**Primary**: Small business owner managing own books

| Attribute | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Who | Owner-operator, 0-5 employees |
| Revenue | $100k-$500k/year (too small for full-time bookkeeper) |
| Current state | Using Xero, doing books themselves, stressed about BAS/GST |
| Core pain | "I didn't start this business to do bookkeeping" |
| Time reality | 3-5 hours/week on books (resents every minute) |
| Money reality | Bookkeeper = $400-800/month (can't justify yet) |
| Fear | Tax surprise, ATO letter, cash flow blindness |

**One-liner**: "Zero Agent is your AI bookkeeping assistant—ask questions about your business finances and get plain-English answers instantly."

**Platform note**: Currently supports Xero. MYOB and QuickBooks planned.

**Working name**: "Pip" (not finalized - market testing required)
- Approachable, friendly, non-threatening
- Pippin (LOTR) vibes - loyal, curious, learns as you go
- Star Atlas connection (future Web3 tie-in)
- Easy: "I'll ask Pip about my cash flow"

**Domain availability** (checked 2025-11-27):
| Domain | Status |
|--------|--------|
| pip.com | ❌ Taken |
| pip.com.au | ❌ Taken |
| pip.au | ❌ Taken (no active site - potential future acquisition) |
| **askpip.au** | ✅ **SECURED** (Black Friday 2024 - FREE) |
| askpip.com.au | ✅ Available (FREE bundle) |
| heypip.com.au | ✅ Available |
| getpip.com | ❌ Taken (Python pip - avoid!) |

**Status**: `askpip.au` secured. Open to paying for premium domains if name wins in market research.

**Rebrand from Zero**: "Zero" sounds like "Xero" when spoken—brand collision risk.

### Rename Plan (Zero Agent → Pip)
Status: Pending validation at Thursday demo

**After name finalized**:
- [ ] Register chosen domain (.com.au)
- [ ] Rename repo: `zero-agent` → `pip` or `askpip`
- [ ] Update packages: `@zero-agent/*` → `@askpip/*`
- [ ] Update PWA branding, copy, UI
- [ ] Update Xero app name in developer portal
- [ ] Update VISION.md, README.md, all docs
- [ ] Redirect zero.rodda.xyz → new domain

### Beta Strategy (25 Users)
| Aspect | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| Size | Max 25 Xero connects |
| Price | Free (token costs absorbed) |
| Distribution | Manual approval only |
| Liability | Clear disclaimer: no liability for mistakes/corrupted data |
| Purpose | Validate usefulness, collect feedback, refine product |

### Distribution Strategy
| Platform | Priority | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------|--------|-------|
| PWA (web) | HIGH | ✅ Live | https://zero.rodda.xyz - functional chat interface |
| Self-hosted (Docker) | HIGH | ✅ Ready | Docker configs in repo, docs available |
| **MCP Remote Server** | HIGH | ✅ Built | `packages/mcp-remote-server` - works with Claude.ai + ChatGPT |
| **ChatGPT App** | HIGH | 🔵 Testing | Same MCP server, ChatGPT Apps SDK integration |
| iOS App Store | LOW | Future | Evaluate after 6 months based on adoption |
| Google Play Store | LOW | Future | Evaluate after 6 months based on adoption |

**MCP-First Distribution Strategy (2025-11-29)**: Major pivot to distribute Pip as a Remote MCP Server. Users connect from their Claude.ai or ChatGPT subscription - we provide Xero tools + Pip personality, they provide LLM inference. **$0 LLM costs for Arc Forge.** See `docs/research-notes/SPIKE-pip-inside-claude-chatgpt.md`.

## Current Focus

### 🎯 Major Pivot: Open Source Platform (2025-11-17)

**Decision**: Pivoting from proprietary SaaS to open source platform (MIT license)
- See `VISION.md` for philosophy
- See `docs/ADR-012-open-source-platform-architecture.md` for technical architecture

**Key Changes**:
1. ✅ **LLM Agnostic**: Support ANY LLM provider (not just Anthropic)
   - API key support: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Grok
   - OAuth support: Google Gemini (now), OpenAI (coming soon)
